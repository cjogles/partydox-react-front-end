# Party Dox :tada:

The front end portion of this full stack app is contained in this repository. I came up with this idea while on vacation with some friends and thought it would be really fun to build. So here it is! It's a web platform where friends can create trips, add activities to them, as well as shopping lists, parking lots, and flights. Eventually friends will be able to update profiles, and collaborate on trips and share them.
